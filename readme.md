#Hexagon space
This is a small project I made where I was seeing how a grid of hexagons can be stored in a 1 dimensional array and used in various algorithms.
##Functions so far:
Theres functions for
- generating the grid
- generating the position of the vertices of the hexagon given its center and radius
- rendering the hexagons
- finding the bordering hexagons of a hexagon given its index in the array
- navigating from 1 hexagon to another with Dijkstra's algorithm
- checking if a point is inside a hexagon or not
